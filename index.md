I am currently employed as an economist in the Markets and Firms unit at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. In September 2020, I will be joining [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research office of the Ministry of Health and Social Policy.

My research interests lie within Labor Economics and Empirical Policy Evaluation, with a special focus on Gender and Family Economics.
