I am currently employed as an economist at [Drees](https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/etudes-et-statistiques/), the statistical and research office of the French Ministry of Solidarity and Health. I was previously employed at [Insee](https://insee.fr/fr/accueil), the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. 

My research interests lie within Labor Economics, Health Economics and Empirical Policy Evaluation, with a special focus on Gender and Family Economics.
