I am currently employed as an economist in the Markets and Firms unit at Insee, the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. In September 2020, I will be joining the Ministry of Health and Social Policy.

My research interests lie within Labor Economics and Empirical Policy Evaluation, with a special focus on Gender and Family Economics.
