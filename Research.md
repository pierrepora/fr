Recent works have concluded that labor earnings dynamics exhibit non-Gaussian and nonlinear features. We argue in this paper that this finding is mainly due to volatility in working time. Using a non-parametric approach, we find from French data that changes in labor earnings exhibit strong asymmetry and high peakedness. However, after decomposing labor earnings growth into growth in wages and working time, deviations from Gaussianity stem from changes in working time. The nonlinearity of earnings dynamics is also mostly driven by working time dynamics at the extensive margin.

### ["Gender Equality on the Labour Market in France: A Slow Convergence Hampered by Motherhood"](https://www.insee.fr/en/statistiques/4253144?sommaire=4253180), with D. Meurs, *Economie et Statistique / Economics and Statistics*, 510-511-512, 109-130, 2019.

In France since the 1970s, the growth in labour force has been driven largely by that of women’s participation in the labour market and the fact that they interrupt their careers less often after motherhood. Their level of education has also risen considerably, and they have, on average, been more highly educated than men since the 1990s. But these developments did not result in reducing the gender pay gap to what might have been expected: the average hourly wage gap in the private sector has remained around 20% since the mid-1990s. In this average gap, the share explained by differences in human capital (education, experience) was cancelled out and even reversed between 1968 and 2015. The persistence of the wage gap now appears to be mainly linked to the consequences of motherhood. A child’s arrival causes mothers a loss of annual income largely due to adjustments in their working time. This penalty is higher for mothers whose wages are at the bottom of the wage distribution.
